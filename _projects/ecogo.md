#### Introduction
EcoGo idea was born during the two-day hackathon (Design Jam) we had for our Projects I course at the Centre for Digital Media. We then continued to develop the idea for the rest of the semester. Our main goal was to change people's walking behaviour by engaging them in an exciting experience. After doing research, we decided to embed gamified features to make to more fun and behaviour changer.

The overall idea is: "Walk and get rewards". The application keeps track of users' walking and their steps and rewards them based on their journies. The rewards can be in-app coins to purchase stuff for avatars and decorating the tree house or coupons from third-party partners to receive offers. Socialized features including friends, competition, and challenges are also embedded in the app. 

**The complete documentation of the project, including all the prototypes (Technical and Figma), steps, researches conducted, solution, monetization, process, etc., is available through <a href="https://steep-eucalyptus-a3f.notion.site/EcoGo-The-Green-Goblins-fcc3caa3b6c94926a2ea839f0462b852" target="_blank">HERE</a>.**

Our team was composed of one product manager, three UI/UX designers, and me as the developer. So, I was responsible for technical implementation of our application.
#### Web Application
As the prototype for our hackathon, we decided to implement a web application to make this idea feasible for everyone. The application was implemented based on the **Angular** and interacted with **Google Maps API** for navigation and tracking. The application presented all the features required for the functionality of the idea.

**Source code of the web application is available through <a href="https://gitlab.thecdm.ca/five-guys/ecogo" target="_blank">here</a>**.

#### Mobile Application
After the hackathon, we took one step further, in order to improve the user experience and features of the application, we shifted to developing a mobile app. We needed an application for both iOS and Android platforms, and resources were limited. Hence, the application was developed through the **Flutter** framework that made us able to have the application for both platforms with just one code base.
