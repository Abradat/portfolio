#### AUTCup 2016
For AUTCup 2016, I developed an application based on **Qt** and **PyQt** framework. Each robotic league has its own page, and teams' list and their score in each level can be submitted.

The source code of the project is available through [here](https://github.com/Abradat/AUTCUP2016Application).
#### AUTCup 2018
I completely redesigned the application for this competition. Instead of an offline qt application, it is a web application based on **beego** framework written in **Go** languages.

The source code of the project is available through [here](https://github.com/abradat/autcup2018-webapp).
