#### API Gateway
API gateways are one of most important patterns in the microservices architecture which will act as the signle entry point to the system.

I have implemented API gateway based on **Netflix Zuul 1** and **Spring Cloud Gateway**. Neflix Zuul 1 is based on **blocking** flow while the Spring Cloud Gateway is implemented on Netty and is a **non-blocking** gateway that notably increases the performance.
#### Inbound API Gateway
This project is a special case of API gateway for the Iranian Instant Payment (IIP) project. It is implemented based on **Netflix** Zuul 1. The gateway exposes REST endpoints to the clinets. It receives requests and publish them to the **Apache Kafka** using Zuul filters. 

The **source code** of the project is available from [here](https://github.com/abradat/inbound-gateway){:target="_blank"}
#### Apache Kafka/MQ Communication
In order to prevent performance decreament in microservices architecture, utilizing **asynchronous** communication besides **synchronous** communications is an essential way. I have implemented communication in microservices through **Apache Kafka** and **IBM MQ**.

Apache Kafka **source code** is available from [here](https://github.com/Abradat/microservice-kafka-messaging){:target="_blank"}  
IBM MQ **source code** is available from [here](https://github.com/Abradat/microservice-mq-messaging){:target="_blank"}
#### Redis Sentinel
Redis Sentinel provides high availability for Redis. In practical terms this means that using Sentinel you can create a Redis deployment that resists without human intervention certain kinds of failures.

I implemented Redis sentinel as a pattern for **distributed configuration** for our services. The **source code** of the project is available from [here](https://github.com/abradat/redis-sentinel){:target="_blank"}
#### Security with OIDC
I implemented security pattern for microservices using **Keycloak**. It provides **OpenID Connect (OIDC)** a thin layer on the top of **OAuth2**.
