#### Introduction
Development of the new version of Central Securities Depository (CSD) system of the Central Bank of Iran (CBI) started from May 2020. Business of the system completely changed. Also, we started writing code from scratch using **Spring Boot** and **Spring** frameworks for back-end development based **microservices** architecture. Also, the Web UI dashboard was completely redesigned and implemented based on **Angular** framework and **Nebular** web kit.

#### My Reponsibilites
As the main developer of the team, I am responsible for:
1. Back-End services development based on **Spring Boot** and **Spring** frameworks.
2. Implemented a non-blocking API Gateway using **Spring Cloud Gateway** basted on Netty.
3. Secured services through **Keycloak** based on OpenID Connect and OAuth2.
4. Redesigned the previous Web UI and developed a new dashboard based on **Angular** framework using **Nebular** web UI kit.
5. **Dockerized** backend services and frontend application.
